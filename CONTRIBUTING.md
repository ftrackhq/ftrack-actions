# Contributing to ftrack-actions

Hi, and thank you for wanting to help contribute to ftrack-actions!

ftrack-actions is currently only supported for use in repositories within the ftrack organization. 

If you have issues running them in external repositories, while it might work and we try not to introduce breaking changes, this is currently not a supported use case and actions may break for any reason.
